#### The scikit-learn Estimators

An **estimator** in this case refers to any object that learns from the data, in Scikit we have numerous type of estimators that have been built for us. Keep in mind that not all estimators are machine learning models, **but they all learn from the data.** The main types of estimators are:

-   Regressors — Supervised learning with continuous data
-   Classifiers — Supervised learning with categorical data
-   Clusterers — Used in Unsupervised learning
-   Transformers — Transform the input/output data
-   Meta-estimators — Learn from other estimators
