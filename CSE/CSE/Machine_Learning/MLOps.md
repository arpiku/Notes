# DevOps 
1. In general the concept is to have a set of best practices to follow in order to create better software fast.
2. DevOps is the set of **best practices**, **tools** and company **culture** aimed at improving the efficiency of software development, testing, deployment and monitoring.

# CI/CD pipeline
1. Continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline.
2. All software needs to be throughly tested and deployed before it can be used.
3. DevOps tries to improve the efficiency of this process by building and automating CI/CD pipelines. Continuous integration (CI) involves the processes around developing software. Continuous deployment/delivery (CD) involves the processes around moving software to production. Best practices and culture are imbedded within the management of these pipelines. 

## Continuous Integration 
1. Generally this means pushing the code to the remote repo regularly and then it getting tested. 
2. We need **Metrics** to ensure our program is working well.
