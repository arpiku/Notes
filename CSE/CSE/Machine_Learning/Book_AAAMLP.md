2. To make sense of unsupervised we can use [[decomposition]] techniques.
3.  Supervised problems are easier in the sense that they can be evaluated easily.
4. [[Cross_Validation]] :
 # Cross Validation:
 1. cross-validation is a step in the process of building a machine learning model which  
helps us ensure that our models fit the data accurately and also ensures that we do  
not #overfit.
