# venv and environment variables
1. Most python projects have dependencie s i.e libraries that were written by someone else, overtime the code might be updated, or some of the libraries fail to work with other ones, this is an issue.
2. Libraries over time add or remove featues, this might lead to the code not working when one of the lib gets an update or loses a particular feature.
3. Virtual enviroment create these 'folders', these environments keep the lib structure constant, i.e the code used in that particular environment used by different libraries doesn't get updated.
4. This prevent your code from breaking when you do some updates, or add some libraries, or python decided to not-backward compatible update.
